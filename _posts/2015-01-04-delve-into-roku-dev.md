# Delve into Roku development
I have decided that I am going to try developing an IP camera channel for the Roku streaming platform.
We still have a Foscam in her room to monitor when she sleeps and when she plays in her room. Lately, she has been playing in her room quite a bit and it would be nice to see her on the TV.
So far the fist step has been downloading the [Roku SDK](https://owner.roku.com/Developer) and uncompressing the file. Now I am going to read over the documentation for BrightScript, the scripting language that Roku apps are based on.
